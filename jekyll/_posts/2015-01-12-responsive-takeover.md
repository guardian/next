With many sections of our newly designed website now fully live, as well as our US and Australian editions, it’s getting hard to refer to what we are doing as a “beta” - although we aren’t going to stop developing the site and listening to the feedback we are receiving as more and more people experience a new theguardian.com.

With that comes the need to ensure that our site is ready not just for our readers but also for that hugely important group of “users” that directly help keep the lights on - our advertising partners.

So it’s with great excitement that we are taking the wraps off an entirely new ad format, pioneered here at theguardian.com. It’s a format designed and developed with the objectives in mind of both the new site - to be a fantastic experience for our readers and a showcase for our journalism across all devices - and those of our advertising partners.

The Guardian’s approach to the proliferation of devices accessing our site (6000 different types per month and counting) has been to craft a single site which works across all of these various screens. This presented a challenge: create an ad format that works equally well responsively, while providing the sort of impact that has been associated with page skins and other high-impact formats on desktop.

The project team took this challenge as seriously as any we have faced - at the Guardian we’ve built a track record of providing advertising partners with innovative solutions that are designed sympathetically with our journalism and user experience.  Building such solutions on a cross-platform site is a huge opportunity to continue to build on that record.

Without further ado, let’s have a look at our new responsive takeover, developed directly with our clients to meet the needs of increasingly mobile-based news consumption. To showcase this we’ll use Google’s Android campaign, the first campaign to book across every one of our live platforms at once. Developed with design agency Oliver and digital agency Essence, it contains three distinct elements:

## 1. Full-width responsive banner.  

This unit is designed to work at the top, middle or bottom of a page at any screen size. It’s flexible enough to appear on any content type, from section fronts to articles, galleries to live blogs. Depending on the browser size and device, the unit shows the all of the elements of the advert optimised for best display on whatever screen you are using:  

<img src="/assets/images/F250.gif" width=100%/>  

To build this unit, we abstracted the various elements of an advert: the background, the subject image, the branding and the call to action. These are then populated individually into the HTML5 ad unit to allow the unit to respond best to the space available. At desktop and tablet the full-bleed unit is 250 high, at mobile it is 100 - providing a serious upgrade in impact without impinging on user experience any more than the equivalent industry-standard banners.  

## 2. Full-width expandable midstream unit.  

Delivered in-line with the content elements of our section fronts, this unit provides the opportunity to expand - literally and figuratively - on the initial message provided in the top banner. Bigger than any other unit displayed directly alongside Guardian journalism, this unit expands automatically the first time it is served to a reader; for subsequent views it then requires a click to expand.  The challenge this unit provides is in ensuring that, no matter what screen size or orientation a reader happens to be utilising, the unit provides impact without creating a major usability issue (for example taking over the whole of a touch screen, making it difficult to navigate onwards).  

Our solution was to make this unit responsive not just to the width of the viewing window, but to the height. Reading the user’s viewable area on arrival to the page, the unit responds by setting its initial height based on this; once in view, it expands to take up a proportion of the screen which, while large enough to make an impact, doesn’t impede the user in onward browsing.   This reflects a new way of thinking about ad-space in the new, device-agnostic web. To quote our head of mobile advertising, Lee Fels - “it’s about percentages, not pixels”.   Here’s how that looks on a number of different screen sizes:

Desktop:

<img src="/assets/images/expandable_desktop.png" width=100%/>

Mobile:

<img src="/assets/images/expandable_mobile.png" width=320px/>

##  3. Cut-out (or “Parallax”) MPU.  

Last but not least - while technically the least challenging of the elements provided in the Responsive Takeover, this unit has raised quite a stir; it provides the sense of a persistent presence of the brand by appearing to sit behind the content of the page - making the ubiquitous 300x250 ad position work hard.  This particular execution represented everything great about collaboration of this kind - the use of an escalator populated by Guardian-reading characters come out of a conversation between the agency designers and Guardian developers - and the results popular (press play below!).

Who knows? We may have coined a new format name - the Escalator.

## And together, these really are better...

In isolation, each of these formats represents something new for both the Guardian and our clients - formats built specifically for our site by the very same team of designers, engineers and product folk that have built the site itself.

Together, they provide the ability for advertisers to deliver the story they are hoping to communicate in a truly integrated way, retaining all the impact of other takeover formats while respecting the reader-oriented design of the site and the world-beating journalism it showcases. 

Better for advertisers, better for the Guardian and better for our readers - I couldn’t put it more succinctly than our EVP of Sales in the US, Carter Brokaw - we’re aiming to <a href="http://adage.com/article/media/guardian-rolls-u-s-redesign-eye-native-ads/295624/">put the elegance back into marketing</a>.
