It’s now been three months since we started rolling out our new site, with the US leading the way back in October last year, followed by Australia in November and many of of our UK sections, including sport, culture, technology, and before Christmas.  As we have done since we first launched the beta site back in February 2014 we have continued listening to feedback. Before Christmas we published a blog on what we’ve learned from your feedback and what we’ve been doing about it. We haven’t stopped there: here is an update on several other changes we have made before the UK launch. 

## Navigation
As well as adding links to crosswords and today’s paper to our “all sections” dropdown we have also introduced a new personalised element which allows you to quickly visit the areas of the site you go to most. These are based on the areas of the site you visit most often, both previously on the old site and now on the new site. You can access it by clicking on the “browse all sections" button on a computer or “all” on a mobile device. Read more about it [here](http://www.theguardian.com/preferences).

## Breaking news
It is now possible to view breaking news alerts on the site, and the alerts will appear faster than ever before. These will appear prominently at the bottom of the page on desktop, tablet and mobile, alerting you that a breaking news event is taking place. You can close the alert by clicking the “x”.

## Topic pages
We have made our topic pages easier to browse by grouping content by date, either by day or month depending on the amount of stories we write. You can see some examples [here](http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling) and [here](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy).

## Colour tones
We introduced what we call a “tonal colour language”, the goal being to give clear visual distinction between different journalistic tones and types, and we have had some user feedback around certain examples of this not working as well as it could. Broadly speaking, news carries the core guardian blue colour; live content is boldly marked with red; galleries, videos and other multimedia take a gun metal hue; and opinion is vibrant orange; non-news (features) carries a purple tone; and review articles are yellow. Whilst it works well for live and reviews we know it doesn’t work as well as it could for features. We are exploring different approaches to the problem, and will be addressing them in the coming weeks.

## Advertising
Advertising is a key part of how we generate revenue from the website but we know we know some of you get frustrated with certain ad formats,, in particular around video. We have now turned off all pre-roll advertising on the site, meaning when you visit a video page the content you came to watch is immediately available. This may change in future but we will always ensure we make changes which are not too disruptive to your experience of using the site.

## Bug fixes and accessibility
Last, but certainly not least, we have spent a lot of time fixing bugs on the site, in particular around certain device / browser combinations which we know are causing you problems. We’ve updated our video pages, meaning more devices can watch our content. We’ve also improved the legibility of our Guardian font, in particular on desktop PC computers. Finally we have also made a number of accessibility improvements, making our site usable to a wider audience.
