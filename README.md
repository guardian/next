  - TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET
* Now get dependecies with `sh grunt`
* Then compile the static assets by running `grunt` from the root of the project
* Next change into the Jekyll directory `cd jekyll`
* Run the Jekyll local server `jekyll serve --baseurl` (more command line options can be found within the [Jekyll docs](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/#serve-command-options))
